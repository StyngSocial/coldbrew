          &nbsp;&nbsp;First, I want to say thank you for testing out Cold Brew!
          I've spent the last three years studying crypto and blockchain with
          the idea of fixing monopolistic tech. I'm proud to release Cold Brew
          as a culmination of that research. Even though it doesn't do much
          right now ðŸ˜†.
